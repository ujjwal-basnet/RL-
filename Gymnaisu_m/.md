# Frozen Lake MDP Example

A simple example of defining a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake environment.

## ðŸ“˜ What is an MDP?

A **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of an agent.

An MDP is defined by:
- **States (S):** Possible situations
- **Actions (A):** Choices the agent can make
- **Transition probabilities (P):** Likelihood of moving from one state to another
- **Rewards (R):** Feedback received after taking actions
- **Discount factor (Î³):** Future reward importance

## ðŸ§  Example Code

```python
import gym

# Define the environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake', is_slippery=True)

# Access action and state space
num_actions = env.action_space.n
num_states = env.observation_space.n

print("Number of actions:", num_actions)
print("Number of states:", num_states)
